# DictionaryDiff

We are currently comparing 10 different european dictionaries with the Levenstein distance.

You have this options:


1. Compare one to the rest
2. Compare one to one
3. Use optimized version

## Levenshtein Formula

The Levenshtein formula, also known as the Levenshtein distance or edit distance, is a measure of the difference between two strings. It calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another.

### Formula

The Levenshtein distance between two strings, often denoted as `lev(s, t)`, is calculated using the following formula:

lev(s, t) = max(|s|, |t|) - LCS(s, t)

where:
- `|s|` is the length of string `s`
- `|t|` is the length of string `t`
- `LCS(s, t)` is the length of the Longest Common Subsequence between strings `s` and `t`

### Optimized version

  In order to avoid O(nÂ²) time complexity, we must compare only words that have similar length. We've developed a python script called `sort.py`.
  In that script, we sort words of every length in ascendent way so that larger words appear at the end of the files. In order to have a quicker access to words of length n, we have also created metadata files. Metadata files are responsible for storaging position of every starter word of determined length.
  
  ### Data
  
  We have chosen this set of european dictionaries:
  
  1. ENGLISH
  2. SPANISH
  3. DANISH
  4. PORTUGUESE
  5. ITALIAN
  6. FRENCH
  7. CATALAN
  8. NORWEGIAN
  9. SWEDISH
  10. GERMAN

Look, in fact, that all use the same character set, so distances won't be that far. Little diferences might be spotted like special characters. 

Data is stored this way:

- Data
  - Metadata
  - Raw
  - Sorted

We have both types of dictionaries, sorted and not, to compare performance on two algorithms.
